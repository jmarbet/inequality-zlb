# Inequality and the Zero Lower Bound

This repository contains the code to solve the model developed in "Inequality and the Zero Lower Bound" by Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, Galo Nuño, Joël Marbet, and Omar Rachedi.

To produce all figures and tables used in the paper, execute `main()` found in `Main.jl`. The code then

1. Solves all HANK model parametrizations,
2. Solves all RANK model parametrizations, and
3. Generates all figures and tables in the paper as well as some auxiliary figures.
